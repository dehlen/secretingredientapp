# Privacy Policy

In the following, we would like to inform you about the purposes, type and scope of the processing of your personal data while using the Recipes App (hereinafter also referred to as the "App"). The legal basis for the level of data protection within the App is the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR).

## 1. Responsible body

Responsible for the processing of personal data within the app is:

David von Knobelsdorff  
Kriegsstra√üe 184  
76133 Karlsruhe

E-Mail: [davidvonknobelsdorff@gmail.com](mailto:davidvonknobelsdorff@gmail.com)  

## 2. Overview of the data processing within the app

The app allows you to organize your recipes. Recipes can either be imported from a website or manually.

When using the app, the data processing that takes place can be divided into three main categories:

*   When you download the app, the necessary information is transferred to the Apple App Store.
*   In order to enable functions of the app (e.g. adding a photo to a recipe), the app needs access to various functions of your mobile device (e.g. saving in picture gallery).
*   In the course of using the App, various information is collected. This is pseudonymized data, for example, to create usage statistics or error reports in order to improve our app.

## 3. Installation of the Recipes app

The Recipes app is available through the App Store operated by Apple Inc. The download may require prior registration with the App Store and installation of the App Store software. We have no control over the collection and processing of your personal information in connection with registering and providing downloads from the App Store. Apple Inc. as the operator of the App Store is solely responsible in this respect.

For more information on this data processing, please refer to the App Store Privacy Policy:

*   Apple Privacy Policy: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

## 4. Use of our app

### 4.1 Purposes of data processing / legal basis

The following data is collected when the app is called up:

*   the mobile device (operating system version, model, resolution, language, etc.) from which you started the app,
*   the IP address of the mobile device,
*   the date and time of access,
*   the app version used.

This data is temporarily stored in a log file for the following purposes:

*   error analysis,
*   improvement of the App.

The legal basis for the above-mentioned data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 letter f) GDPR.

### 4.2 Required authorisations

In order for our app to function properly, it is necessary for you to allow and grant access to certain functions of your terminal device, so that certain data is stored on your terminal device. You will be prompted to grant the appropriate access authorization once at the beginning or when you use the respective function.

#### Folder in which your photos / media / files of the mobile device / USB memory contents are stored (read/change/delete).

If you create recipes, they will be stored directly in the memory of your mobile device, depending on the installation location of the app.

The app allows you to synchronize created recipes across all your devices using iCloud. You can disable syncing in the iCloud system settings.

Recipes stored on your stored device will not be transferred to us.

#### Network access & connections

An Internet connection is only required when sending crash reports and usage statistics.

#### Other device functions or device sensors

You can send recipes you have created to other people. A system dialog will appear where you can share your content (e.g. via contacts, e-mail, social media). A data processing by us as well as a transmission of the contact data to us does not take place.

#### Feedback function via e-mail

If you want to give us feedback, you can do so via the e-mail form within the app. We ask you not to send any further personal data of you or other persons within the feedback function to us. The legal basis for data processing within the framework of the feedback function is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Your feedback messages will be deleted after 4 weeks.

#### Usage statistics

To improve our app, anonymized usage statistics are sent to us. The data collected in the process is not linked to your person.

The App uses the Microsoft AppCenter SDK to determine the popularity of suggested features (usage count) and other overall statistics (such as operating system version and device model) to help us better target our development efforts to future releases.

We base the data processing on our justified interest in improving the App. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 Par. 1 letter f) GDPR.

If you do not wish to receive statistics on the use of the App and wish to prevent the sending of usage statistics, you can deactivate these functions at any time in the App's settings using the slider (right of objection according to Art. 21 GDPR).

In addition, usage statistics can be collected by the system via Apple Inc. This system setting is not specific to the Recipes App and can be deactivated in the device settings.

#### Error reports

If a crash occurs in the app, anonymous crash reports (function tracing, operating system version, device model) are automatically collected to help us troubleshoot crashes in our applications. We also use the Microsoft AppCenter SDK for this purpose. We base the data processing on our legitimate interest in improving the App. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para.1 lit. f) GDPR.

If you do not want anonymous crash reports to be sent to us via the Microsoft AppCenter SDK, you can deactivate these functions at any time using the slider in the app's settings (right of objection according to Art. 21 GDPR).

In addition, system-side error reports can be collected via Apple Inc. This system setting is not specific to the Recipes App and can be deactivated in the device settings.

## 5. Recipient of your data

Unless you disable this feature, the app statistics will be sent to Microsoft, Corp. For more information about Microsoft's privacy policy and the AppCenter SDK, please see:

*   [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/gdpr/install-id](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/gdpr/install-id)

## 6. Linked websites

If you access websites via the in-app browser (e.g. via links), your personal data will be processed on these websites in deviation from this privacy policy. This privacy policy only applies to our App. We ask you to read the privacy policies of the linked websites. We are not responsible for the websites linked within the App and do not endorse their content. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content as well as for damages resulting from the use or non-use of the information, the provider of the website to which the link was made is solely liable.

## 7. Your privacy rights

According to Art. 15 para. 1 GDPR you have the right to request information about the personal data we have stored about you.

In addition, if the legal requirements are met, you have the right to correct (Art. 16 GDPR), delete (Art. 17 GDPR) and restrict the processing (Art. 18 GDPR) of your personal data.

If data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e) or f) GDPR, you have the right to object under Art. 21 GDPR. If you object to data processing, it will not be carried out in future unless the data controller can prove that there are compelling reasons for further processing worthy of protection which outweigh the data subject's interest in objecting.

If you yourself have provided the processed data, you have a right to data transfer in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR.  
If the data processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a) GDPR, you may revoke such consent at any time with effect for the future, without affecting the legality of the previous processing.

In the above-mentioned cases, in case of open questions or complaints, please contact the above-mentioned contact address in writing or by e-mail.

You also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority. The data protection supervisory authority of the federal state in which you live or in which the person responsible is based is responsible.

## 8. Modification or adjustment of the data protection declaration

This privacy policy is current and dated September 23, 2020, and may be subject to change as our app develops or new technologies are implemented.
